**Prediction**

In this year election, the fight has been made triangular after Ram Tahal Choudhry decided to fight election independently against BJP. He left BJP after he was not named BJP's candidate for Ranchi Lok Sabha seat. This has given a slight edge to INC's candidate Subodh Kant Sahay as Ramtahal Choudhry is previously in BJP and this time he is fighting election independently. But PM Modi's popularity can save BJP or Not. Win or loss will be decided by the voters on the 6th of May. It will also be important to see that in which area of Ranchi will have maximum polling. Booth management will also be important that which candidate can bring his voters to the polling booth. As we are seeing that the fight is tough this time in comparison with the 2014 election. Now we have to wait till 23rd May as who comes out with the winner crown.
